# This is intended for private nameservers: if you have a nameserver on your network which deals with names of the form
# xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk at 192.168.1.1 then giving  the server=/internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1  will
# send all queries for internal machines to that nameserver, everything else will go to the servers in /etc/resolv.conf
# The  special  server  address '#'means, "use the standard servers", so server=/google.com/1.2.3.4
# server=/www.google.com/# will send queries for *.google.com to 1.2.3.4, except *www.google.com which will be for‚Äê
# warded as usual.
